## About Project

This project has been created as a part of Udacity's Front End Web Development nanodegree. The starter code has been provided by Udacity.

I used JavaScript object-oriented programming to implement Game objects and functionality.


## Game Rules

A player manages hero using arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
Hero must cross the board from grass area to the river. Hero must avoid bugs.
If collision happens, hero is reset in the original position.
Game won when hero reaches the river.
